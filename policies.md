Numeric Café Policies
=====================

1. As soon as we have a Code of Conduct, follow that. In the mean time, don’t be a jerk.
1. [Andrew Janke]() is currently the sole site admininistrator. If we get big, we’ll add more admins.
  1. Andrew wields the banhammer, and will use it if necessary and at his discretion!
1. Be aware that this is a public Slack, and anybody anywhere may see what you write.
  1. In particular, be careful not to post any confidential or proprietary business stuff
1. No public logging, please, even though this is a public Slack. We want it to maintain an ephemeral feel.
1. No piracy or posting of proprietary / closed-source code.
  1. In particular, do not post source code to Matlab itself! (This means the `.m` file source code that is part of the Matlab installation.) Even though you can see this source inside the Matlab editor, it is proprietary closed-source code, and you do not have a license to share it.
1. Job postings, freelancing pitches, and other commercial appeals are allowed, but should be restricted to the `#pitches-and-postings` channel.
1. Enjoy!
