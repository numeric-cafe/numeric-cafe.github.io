Numeric Café
============

This is the companion web site for the [Numeric Café Slack space](https://numericcafe.slack.com).


Numeric Café is a public Slack for the discussion of programming and use of Matlab, Octave, R, numeric Python (NumPy/SciPy/pandas), and similar numeric and scientific programming languages.

Numeric Café is an experiment set up by [Andrew Janke](https://apjanke.net), to see if a public Slack makes a good discussion environment for scientific programming, with an aim to support both commercial and open source programmers, and a primary focus on Matlab.
The café’s population is currently just me and a couple colleagues.
I’ll be hanging out there and dishing out free Matlab and Octave programming advice to whoever wanders in.

All are welcome at Numeric Café.
To get an invite to the Slack space, send an email to <andrew@apjanke.net>.
Or, if you have an email address at `@octave.org`, `@gnu.org`, `@mathworks.com`, or certain `.edu` addresses, you can create an account automatically [on the signup page].
If you have a domain you’d like added to that list, just email me at <andrew@apjanke.net>.

## Café Policies

To come!

There is no established Code of Conduct, but I intend to have one, probably modeled on dev conference code of conducts.

Café policies besides the TBD Code of Conduct can be found on the [Policies page](policies.md).

The Code of Conduct and [Policies](policies.md) can be summed up as “Don’t be a jerk”.
We just need to flesh that out.
