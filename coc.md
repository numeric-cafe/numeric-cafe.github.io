Numeric Café Code of Conduct
============================

Numeric Café is currently too young and small to have a formal Code of Conduct, mostly because that would
mean Andrew unilaterally imposing one on the space before there's a community to form a consensus about
it.

In the mean time, here is an informal Code of Conduct.

1. Don't be a jerk.
1. Numeric Café is an inclusive, welcoming space for all, regardless of race, gender identity or expression, age, nationality, sexuality, and so on.
1. Behavior that is inconsistent with that principle is unacceptable and will not be allowed or tolerated.
1. Take the following other Codes of Conduct as informative references as to acceptable behavior:
    1. [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org)
    1. [rOpenSci Code of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/)
    1. [Software Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)
1. Violations or other problems may be reported to the Space Administrator at <andrew@apjanke.net>.
    1. TODO: Post a GPG public key and Signal contact for secure, private reporting.
1. The Space Administrator will review and enforce remedies for all complaints, at their discretion.
    1. Enforcement actions may include verbal warnings, deletion of content, temporary or permanent bans, or in extreme cases, referral to legal authorities.
    1. I recognize that this is less than ideal. The blunt fact of the matter is that it leaves adjudication and enforcement in the sole hands of a straight white cis man. But since this space is just starting, we have no community to draw Conduct Board members from yet.
1. If you feel unsafe, unwelcome, or uncomfortable for any reason, contact the Space Administrator, and they'll try to do something about it.


If this space grows enough, we'll establish a formal Code of Conduct, and expand adjudication and enforcement responsibility to a multi-person board.
