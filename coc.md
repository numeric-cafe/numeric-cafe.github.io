Numeric Café Code of Conduct
============================

April 23, 2019

Numeric Café is currently too young and small to have a formal Code of Conduct, mostly because that would
mean Andrew unilaterally imposing one on the space before there’s a community to form a consensus about
it.

Once we reach 100 active users, I will attempt to establish a consensus-supported formal Code of Conduct, supported by polls open to all active users, and with reference to other well-established CoCs.

In the mean time, here is an informal Code of Conduct.

1. Don't be a jerk.
1. Numeric Café is an inclusive, welcoming space for all, regardless of race, gender identity or expression, age, nationality, disability, sexuality, or belonging to any other marginalized or historically oppressed group.
1. Behavior that is inconsistent with items #2 is unacceptable and will not be allowed or tolerated.
1. Take the following other Codes of Conduct as informative references as to acceptable behavior:
    1. [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org)
    1. [rOpenSci Code of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/)
    1. [Software Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)
1. Violations or other problems may be reported to the Space Administrator at <andrew@apjanke.net>.
    1. In an emergency, contact Andrew on his cell phone at 206-427-0319.
    1. TODO: Post a GPG public key and Signal contact for secure, private reporting.
1. The Space Administrator will review and enforce remedies for all complaints, at their discretion.
    1. Enforcement actions may include verbal warnings, deletion of content, temporary or permanent bans, or other action as necessary.
    1. I recognize that this is less than ideal. But since this space is just starting, we have no community to draw Conduct Board members from yet.
1. If you feel unsafe, unwelcome, or uncomfortable for any reason, contact the Space Administrator, and they'll try to do something about it.

For now, Andrew Janke (<andrew@apjanke.net>) is the sole Space Administrator.
As the space grows, and as community support allows, steps will be taken to find a more democratic and inclusive governance system.
