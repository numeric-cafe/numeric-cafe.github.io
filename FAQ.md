## Why have a Slack?

Things are kind of lonely as a commercial Matlab programmer.
Matlab doesn't seem to have the same sort of community, especially for open source Matlab development, as many other programming languages do.
So I decided to set up a Slack and see if I can attract other Matlab and other programmers to it.

There are other places for discussion of Matlab and other programming, such as the ##matlab channel on freenode IRC. I decided to try setting up a Slack specifically, because Slack has some advantages:

* In-line posting of images, such as figures or screenshots
* Formatted posting of code snippets
* Offline delivery of messages, without requiring users to set up an IRC bouncer or similar
* Emoji and reaction thingies
* Administrative controls, for banning jerks

Slack also seems to be a nice place to foster a community spirit, and I haven’t seen something like that for Matlab programmers.

## Where else can I get help?

For Matlab, you can try:

* The ##matlab IRC channel on freenode
* The `matlab` tag on Stack Overflow
* MathWorks Answers on mathworks.com

For Octave:

* The ##octave IRC channel on freenode
* The octave issue tracker on GNU Savannah

For R and numeric Python, there are too many resources to list here.
Just Google for "<language> programming help" for them.
